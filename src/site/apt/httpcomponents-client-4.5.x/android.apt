HttpClient for Android

    Google Android 1.0 was released with a pre-BETA snapshot of Apache HttpClient. To coincide with 
    the first Android release Apache HttpClient 4.0 APIs had to be frozen prematurely, while many 
    of interfaces and internal structures were still not fully worked out. As Apache HttpClient 4.0 
    was maturing the project was expecting Google to incorporate the latest code improvements into 
    their code tree. Unfortunately it did not happen. Version of Apache HttpClient shipped with 
    Android has effectively become a fork.

    Eventually Google decided to discontinue further development of their fork while refusing to upgrade
    to the stock version of Apache HttpClient citing compatibility concerns as a reason for such decision.
    Google completely removed their fork of Apache HttpClient from Android in version 8.0 (API 26) only.

    Those users who want to continue using Apache HttpClient on Android are advised to 
    consider 

    * Apache HttpCLient 5.x stock version, which works well with Android API 19 and newer
    
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents.client5' , name: 'httpclient5' , version: '5.0-beta4'
}
----

    * Apache HttpClient packages for Android {{{https://github.com/smarek/httpclient-android/wiki/Project-Introduction}
    maintained by Marek Sebera}} when targeting Android API 23 and newer

----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'cz.msebera.android' , name: 'httpclient', version: '4.5.8'
}
----

    * {{{https://ok2c.github.io/httpclient-android-ext/}Android extensions}} for Apache HttpClient 4.5
    when targeting Android API 26 or newer.

    Android extensions for Apache HttpClient provide a replacement for the default <<<HostnameVerifier>>>
    implementation incompatible with Android and provide a builder for <<<PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager>>>
    instances optimized for Android called <<<AndroidHttpClientConnectionManagerBuilder>>>.
